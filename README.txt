I'm a Data Analyst with a passion for turning data into clear, actionable insights using SQL, data visualization, and storytelling. I enjoy exploring patterns, solving problems, and building tools that help make better decisions.

Outside of work, I like to experiment with Python projects and spend time on indie game development using the Godot Engine â€” a creative outlet where I explore design and a bit of pixel art fun.

On this GitHub, you'll find:

    Data analysis and visualization projects

    Python tools, notebooks, and experiments

    Personal game dev projects and prototypes
